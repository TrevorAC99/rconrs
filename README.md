# rconrs
The is a very simple client for the Source RCON (Remote Console) protocol that is described at https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_RCON_Protocol. This program should be ran in a terminal, so spin up your favorite one and run it. It will ask for the host, the port, and the password. Assuming you have entered the credentials correctly, you will be able to type in your commands and execute them by pressing enter. The command ```quit``` will exit the RCON session and close the program.

This project has been created for use with Minecraft servers, but it probably works for other servers the utilize RCON.

I'll clean up the code and add a license soon (hopefully), but I'm a working college student so I can't guarantee anything. I put this together in a couple hours and I'm no Rust expert, so I make no claims about the quality of the code.

If you are new to Rust and want to understand what my code is doing, go to https://www.rust-lang.org/ to see how to get started.
